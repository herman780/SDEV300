    <h2> Some information about the country of Germany! </h2>
    <p>
        The country of Germany is one of the Europe's largest countries, and the country of Germany
        encompasses a huge variety of of landscapes such as the tall, the sheer mountains of the south;
        the sandy, rolling plains of the north; and the plains of the agricultural east overall. The
        east-central city of Berlin which still has a phoenixlike environment from the ashes of World War II.
        Germany is a member of the European Union, one-third of Germany is still covered with forests and
        woodlands. Germany is also a parliamentary and federal democracy. An important fact is that all
        higher public institutions such as private and public universities in Germany are free (even 
        for non-Germans). Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein have German as the 
        official language.

      in Berlin. -->
    <h3> BERLIN'S BRANDENBURG GATE </h3>
    <p>
        When I get a chance to go to Germany my first site to tour and visit would be the Brandenburg 
        gate which is located in Berlin, Germany. The site has an interesting historial envision to it
        as it was the symbol of Berlin and the German division during the Cold War. When I saw the picture 
        of the gate I got interested to look at the architectural appearance of how the Brandenburg gate is 
        designed and how it was built since it looked really amazing in its architectural scheme of things.

    <!-- This will be another section which will discuss my interest in another site in the 
    country of Germany, the Museum Island in Germany. -->
    <h3> BERLIN'S MUSEUM ISLAND </h3>
    <p>
        Museum Island is located in the center of Berlin. I want to also visit this site to learn 
        about the five internal museums which contain the prehistory to the 19th century art content. 
        I like to see different types of art, so I would be glad and inspired to see the various
        collections of art, but also the ensemblement of the historic buildings on this overall island
        as it offers a fantastic and beautiful architectural appearance which the city of Berlin in 
        Germany has to offer to the best of its architectural ability.
