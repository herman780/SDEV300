    <h2> Some information about the country of Spain! </h2>
    <p>
        The country of Spain is filled of castles, snowcapped mountains, and sophisticated cities,
        and much more. It is made a favoured travel destination for most travelers and explorers. Spain
        has a Parliamentary monarchy form of government. Spain occupies the area of most of the 
        Iberian Peninsula and stretching south from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Strait of Gibraltar, which
        overall separates Spain from Africa. Spain is bordered to the west by Portugal; to the northeast
        it borders France.

    <h3> PLAZA MAYOR, MADRID </h3>
    <p>
        As I learned about the country of Spain, I really had the interest to explore and tour Plaza
        Mayor because of its history and wanted to learn more about the architecture of the buildings
        at the plaza since I know that the architecture of the buildings are from the Renaissance
        period and I thought that was amazing!

    <h3> LA RAMBLA, BARCELONA </h3>
    <p>
        I am interested as well to tour the La Rambla in Spain and I am interested because of
        the fact that La Rambla gathers five streets in one which includes Canaletas, Estudios,
        San José, Capuchinos and Santa Mónica
